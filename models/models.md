# Best Models for Credit risk modelling 

The choice of the best model for credit risk modeling can depend on various factors, including the specific characteristics of the dataset, the requirements of the application, and the performance metrics that are prioritized (e.g., accuracy, interpretability, speed). Here are some commonly used models for credit risk modeling, along with their strengths:

## Logistic Regression:

- Strengths: High interpretability, ease of implementation, robustness to overfitting if regularized.
- Use Case: Often used as a baseline model for binary classification problems, such as predicting default or no default.
